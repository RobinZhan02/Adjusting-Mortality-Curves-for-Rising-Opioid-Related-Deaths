"More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd.html#Georgia-Reporting-Anomalies."

"R99, ""Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality"" and therefore unusually low death counts in other ICD-10 codes,"

"5. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"

"6. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"

"7. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
